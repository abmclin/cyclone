title: Released Cyclone Scheme 0.20
excerpt: We now have official support for calling Scheme from C.
---

Features

- Added the ability to call Scheme code from C. This includes:
  - C function `Cyc_scm_call` which allows execution of arbitrary Scheme code, and returns objects that can be safely used by the caller.
  - C function `Cyc_scm_call_no_gc`. This function imposes more restrictions but does not register with the Cyclone garbage collector so there is less overhead.
  - Full code examples in the `examples/call-scm-from-c` directory in the Cyclone source tree.
- Added the `-COBJ` compiler flag to allow Cyclone to link an executable using objects that are generated by an external source such as a makefile.
